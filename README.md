# EZ Flights Airline Website

## Motivation:
  The goal of the project was to create a complete Airline Reservation System. An Airline
  Reservation System is a web application through which individuals can reserve and pay
  for flights in order to travel to different countries and sometimes domestic cities. Each
  airline usually has its own website through which reservations (bookings) can be made.
